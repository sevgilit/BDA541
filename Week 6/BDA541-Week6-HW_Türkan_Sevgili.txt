VIDEO RELATED QUESTIONS

1) In videos, we saw how the problem was solved when the uncertain inputs distribution is given. 
But we generally may not know the distributions in real life problems. (uniform or normal?)
How is the simulation applied in such situations? How to decide on distribution of uncertain inputs?

2) Each time we run the simulation, we got a result that very close to mean number but different values.
Does it mean that we can not give exact answers to questions?

3) If we can not reach analytic solver platform full add-in, maybe we can also use generate random numbers functions like RAND and NORM.INV in excel solution.
I tried in profit analysis problem as NORM.INV(RAND(), Mean, standard_dev). Could it also be usable?

4) In Airline Revenue Management problem, first we simulate also we optimize the number of first class row.
